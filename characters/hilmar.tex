\AdditionalFeaturesAndTraits{I was the second son in our family. And as family tradition dictated, I was to dedicate my life to religion. Our local cleric took up
my training. We were a class of three. And pretty soon, it was clear that the clerical life was not for me. But it wasn't that
supernatural presences were completely outside my grasp. That is, some of the religious teachings strangely escaped my grasp, but others
I could make happen quite well. Healing was no problem. One thing became clearer and clearer to me - my religious experience was very
different from the the one of my peers.

And in class, I kept feeling my mind drift. And during my offtime, I found myself playing at cards and dice. I played the flute in the
tavern. Could almost have been a bard. I made bets with my friends during the yearly festival, we bet on sports, dogs, even children
playing. Everywhere, I found myself drawn to wherever chance could make a big difference. And when finally I noticed how may little
games co-occurred with that supernatural presence, I found my calling. I said my goodbyes, became my own cleric, and left town on
my first big bet.
}

\Characterbackground{I've always been fascinated with chance. The first time I had dared my baby sister to climb a tree near our home. As she climbed higher, I felt the hairs on my feet
rise. And just when my neck started to tingle, my sister lost her grip, fell down, and landed head first on a rock. Unscathed.

The second time, I had postponed my chores for the better part of the day, and my dad had begun to lose his temper. As
he crossed the room, I felt that same tingle. He bumped his toe, tumbled forward, landed on a pillow, and broke his neck. Dead.
That day, I learned not to tempt the powers of fate and luck, for the Lady may pull, but the Lord might push. And that's how I
became a religious man.

I more and more felt the Lady's pull. Soon after, I began to hold bets, to dare people to test their luck. I always carried my dice with
me, and at our festival, I encouraged people to make bets and take chances. Last year, I made a bet ad cast the dice myself:
A week of revelry for the Lady's pull, or a week away from home on my own for the Lord's push.
I lost that one, and now it has been much longer than a week since I left home...
